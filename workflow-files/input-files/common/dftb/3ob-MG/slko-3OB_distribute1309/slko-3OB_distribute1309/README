All parameters are designed for DFTB3 and are NOT compatible with any MIO parameter 
files, as we have changed electronic and repulsive parameters. 

CHNO: this set is very well benchmarked and improves over MIO for 
      non-covalent distances, e.g. water dimer distance. Furthermore 
      overbinding is removed for most part.
      Special parameters:  
      hh-mod.spl --> use if absolute energy of a covalent H-H bond is 
                     important
      hn-mod.spl/nh-mod.spl --> use for proton affinities of sp3-
                     hybridized nitrogen species.
      cc-freq.spl,cn-freq.spl/nc-freq.spl,co-freq.spl/oc-freq.spl 
                --> use if stretch-frequencies are important rather 
                    than energetics (all files are fully compatible
                    with all other 3ob files!)

S:    Gives reasonable energetics (one exception is SO3!) and overall 
      good bond lengths/angles/dihedrals. Reveals problems for non-
      covalent interactions as e.g. in (SH2)-Y (Y=SH2,H2O,NH3) and also
      its protonated and deprotonated forms.

P:    Reasonable for reaction energies and geometries. Large errors 
      (MAD ~10 kcal/mol) are found for phosphate hydrolysis reactions, 
      especially for those including pentavalent phosphorous.  
      Special parameters:
      l02 --> those fix the hydrolysis problem, but therefore are bad
           for other energetics where P-O breaking/forming is involved.

Compression radii:
c3.3-6.5-h3.0-2.5-n2.8-10.0-o2.5-6.0
s3.8-4.4-9.0
p3.6-4.4-9.0

The following zeta and Hubbard derivative parameters should be used:
(atomic units)
zeta: 4.00
C     -0.1492
H     -0.1857
N     -0.1535
O     -0.1575
S     -0.11   
P     -0.14

While the Hubbard derivatives are calculated from PBE for C,H,N, and O,
they are fitted for S and P to improve on proton affinities. If SCC-
convergence problems appear (please report to me), it might help to 
change the Hubbard derivatives towards their calculated values,
-0.0695 and -0.0701 for S and P, respectively. Note, that this change 
will cause a less good description for proton affinities though!
