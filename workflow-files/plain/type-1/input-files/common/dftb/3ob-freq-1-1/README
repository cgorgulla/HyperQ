SPECIFIC PURPOSE PARAMETER SET

name            requires    elements
3obmod:freq     3ob         C-C|C-N|C-O

short description:
modified 3ob-parameters for vibrational frequencies

detailed description:
This extension improves vibrational stretch frequencies for the
C-C, C-N, and C-O interactions, however, energetics are described
not as good as the general purpose set 3ob. Note the complete
compatibility with 3ob, i.e. either all 3ob-freq parameters might
be used in combination with 3ob, or only one single interaction 
(e.g. only C-N.skf and N-C.skf).

Zeta and Hubbard derivative parameters remain the same as for 3ob.
